										<h2><a name = "overview">Overview</a></h2>
										<p>
										The purpose of this assignment is to familiarize students with the JSON-based scene file format we will be using in the ray tracing assignment.  In particular, students will be making a variety of scenes to test their knowledge of scene graphs and of 4x4 transformation matrices.  The assignment will culminate in the first art contest of our class, in which students design their own scenes out of the basic building blocks that exist in the engine.
										</p>
										
										<h3>Getting Started</h3>
										<p>
										You will be writing a series of JSON scene files in this assignment.  It is possible to everything (except for possibly the art contest) by writing and uploading your scene files to <a href = "../../Materials/ggslac/viewers/SceneViewer.html">the scene viewer</a> from the course web site.  However, for the art contest and also to prepare for future assignments in this class, you will need to run some code from a local web server on your computer to prevent <a href = "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS/Errors">Cross-Origin Errors</a> form happening when the engine loads shaders and other resources.  To get this setup, please follow the instructions below.
                                        </p>

                                                    Clone or download the <a href = "https://github.com/ctralie/ggslac">ggslac repository</a>, which contians an engine that Dr. Tralie made for this class, and which you will be using to render and interact with scene files.

If you are installing Python for the first time, it is recommended that you use <a href = "https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/">Python 3.7 from Anaconda</a>.  Once you have Python installed, open up your console and navigate to the root of the <code>ggslac</code> directory.  Then type

                                            The scene files are written in JSON syntax, and they specify a tree structure.  Each node in the tree has the following three fields
                                            <ol>
                                                <li><b><u>transform:</u></b>
                                                    <p>
                                                        Every node in the scene graph has a 4x4 transform matrix associated to it, which describes where to place it relative to its parent's coordinate system.  The entire subtree will be transformed by this matrix on the left.  If no matrix is provided, the identity matrix is assumed
                                                    </p>

                                            The <a href = "https://github.com/ctralie/ggslac/blob/master/scenes/sample-scene.json">sample.scene.json</a> file bundled with ggslac is a fairly comprehensive example of the possibilities (<a href = "../../Materials/ggslac/viewers/SceneViewer.html">Click here</a> to view this scene interactively).  An annotated screenshot of the code is shown below, with the resulting scene tree superimposed on the right.  We make the following observations about this example:
                                            
                                            <ul>
                                                <li>Node 2 is a "dummy node," as it has no shapes associated to it; it only has a transformation (45 degree rotation about y and a translation by 2 in the +x direction).  So it is merely used to transform the shapes below it, not to include any shapes of its own.</li>

                                                <li>
                                                    Node 3 contains a unit cube, which it scales by 2x in the x direction to turn it into a 2x1x1 rectangular prism.  To further continue up the tree to world coordinates, it is then rotated by 45 degrees about y, translated by 2 in +x, and translated by 0.5 in +y.  (Note that flipping the rotation in node 2 with the scale in node 3 would actually end up shearing the shape).
                                                </li>

                                                <li>
                                                    Nodes 3, 4, 5, and 6 are all "leaf nodes," as they have no children, so the tree stops there.
                                                </li>

                                                <li>

To place the shapes at different positions and to scale them in different directions, we actually rely on the shape parameters (center, radius, height) instead of transformation matrices.  Though one could accomplish the translation and scaling with a matrix as well.
