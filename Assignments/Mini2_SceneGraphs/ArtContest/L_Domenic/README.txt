I consent to have my art contest submission posted publicly on the class web site. My name/pseudonym for public display is L_Domenic

My piece is inspired by Destiny 2. The above scene generated by the planets.json is based on the Destinations menu with all the various planets and celestial 
bodies that you can travel to. The scene below is a very simplified version of Hella's Basin on Mars. It is a region of Mars which used to be used as a transport
rail from one facility to another, but became over run with enemies and unusable. The bridge/rail system has some storage crates(red boxes) that were left behind
as well as broken down and separted train cars(blue boxes). On either end of the bridge, there are buildings/docks in which the items would travel to and from.

It took about an hour and a half to do the first 4 parts, which a lot of the time went in to getting used to the syntax. As for the art contest, I spent about
five hours working on it and getting everything to where I thought it looked good and I didn't have any shapes clipping out where they weren't supposed to be.

I think this was an extremely fun assignment, and once you get passed the syntax, its not too challenging at all. A lot of time goes into making sure figures
are in the right positions or in the right orientations, but I think it is all well worth it to see the end products.
