Aliaksandr Hladkou

I consent to have my art contest submission posted publicly on the class web site. My name/pseudonym for public display is Aliaks

For me personally, it took few hours to get first four parts done. However, I had to spend a lot more time on making own scene because of the limited imagination.

I really like this assignment. Math and logic, all I need. This assignment also helps me to answer many "what-if" questions right away because it is easy to see the result.

For task 5 I am going to upload more than one scene. In order to see full project running, please open "rubies-scene.json"
