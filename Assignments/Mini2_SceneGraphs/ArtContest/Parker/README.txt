2. I consent to have my art contest submission posted publicly on the class web site. My name/pseudonym for public display is Parker Fairchild.
3. It think it took me around 8 hours to do this entire assignment, but most of that was the art contest.
4. I loved this assignment.
5. "giantpokemon.json" is my art contest submission, it includes "pokemonbattle.json" as part of it.
The scene depicts two giant Pokemon interfering with a friendly Pokemon battle. In "giantpokemon.json", be sure to
turn off the "Show camera" marker, and look at both cameras. You'll want to take a good look at the yellow Pokemon trainer.
