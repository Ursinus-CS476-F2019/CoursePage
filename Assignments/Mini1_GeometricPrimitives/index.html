										<h2><a name = "overview">Overview</a></h2>
										<p>
										The purpose of this assignment is to get students hands on practice with fundamental concepts from vector math and also to introduce them to Javascript and the <a href = "http://glmatrix.net/">glmatrix library</a> (version 3.1), and particularly the <a href = "http://glmatrix.net/docs/module-vec3.html">vec3</a> class.  Students will implement a series of mini algorithms using vector concepts that are commonly used in larger geometry systems.  These are real world primitive operations that pop up all the time in graphics, robotics, and physics simulations, to name a few of the many application areas.  For a large number students, this will serve as an introduction to translating mathematics into code, which is an extremely useful but sometimes underrepresented skill.
										</p>
										
										<p>
										This assignment is split up into two parts to keep everyone on track.  You will have five days to complete each part.  It is highly recommended that you move onto the second part as soon as you finish the first part, as the second part is conceptually trickier.
										</p>
										
										<h3>Getting Started</h3>
										<p>
										To get started, check out or download the code in the two github repositories for each part at
										
										<ul>
											<li><a href = "https://github.com/Ursinus-CS476-F2019/Mini1_GeometricPrimitives_Part1">https://github.com/Ursinus-CS476-F2019/Mini1_GeometricPrimitives_Part1</a></li>
											<li><a href = "https://github.com/Ursinus-CS476-F2019/Mini1_GeometricPrimitives_Part2">https://github.com/Ursinus-CS476-F2019/Mini1_GeometricPrimitives_Part2</a></li>
										</ul>
										
										You will be editing code in the file <code><b>GeomPrimitives.js</b></code>.  All of the <code>.html</code> files are GUI front end debugging tools for you to check to make sure your code is working properly, as will be described in the individual tasks.  I have included a <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minification_%28programming%29">minified</a> version of the <a href = "http://glmatrix.net/">glmatrix</a> library which contains the <code>vec3</code> class for manipulating 3D vectors, as well as a minified version of the <a href = "https://plot.ly/javascript/">plot.ly</a> library for 3D plotting (which I used to help create some GUI visualizations to help you debug...no need to worry about it unless you're interested).
										</p>
										
										<h3>Collaboration</h3>
										
										<p>
										This is an individual assignment, so all code must be completely your own.  However, feel free to post questions on Microsoft Teams and to work with each other on the conceptual math part.  Also, if you need help debugging, it is fine to show each other Javascript code that you develop for that purpose (just not code that you write for the actual implementations in <code>GeomPrimitives.js</code>).  If you are unsure if something is allowed, please ask.
										</p>
										
										<div id = "tips">
										<h3>Tips</h3>
										<ul>
										<li>
										Be sure to carefully reference the documentation of the <a href = "http://glmatrix.net/docs/module-vec3.html">vec3</a> class as you go along.  Be sure to allocate new vector objects with <code>vec3.create()</code> or <code>vec3.fromValues()</code> before storing results in them or using them in any way.<BR><BR>
										</li>
										<li>
										Since this is our first Javascript assignment, don't forget to hit <code>F12</code> to bring up the powerful debugging suite, including the console and the ability to set breakpoints.  Use logging in the console with <code>console.log("Test strings" + x + whatever)</code> to output intermediate values to the debug console.<BR><BR>
										</li>
										
										<li>
										Ask questions on Microsoft Teams as you are going along and get stuck.  Javascript is very "loose" with declarations and types, so there are many things that can happen that wouldn't happen in other languages.  One of the most common errors I have personally made is accidentally re-using variable names.  This is particularly bad when the original variable was an object and the new variable is a numerical value, and then I try to use the numerical value as if it were an object.  This will commonly manifest itself as some kind of "undefined" variable if you log it to the console.
										</li>
										</div>
										
										</ul>
										
										<h2><a name = "submission">Submission Instructions</a></h2>
										
										You will submit two versions of <b><code>GeometricPrimitives.js</code></b> to Canvas when you are finished.  The first version will contain implementations of tasks 1-4 (<b>due Wednesday 9/4 at 11:59PM</b>), and the second version will contain implementations of tasks 5, 6, and 7 (<b>due Friday 9/13</b>).  Please also submit a <b><code>README.txt</code></b> file with both submissions with the following information each time:
										<ol>
										<li>Your name<BR><BR></li>
										<li>Approximately how many hours it took you to finish this assignment (<i>I will not judge you for this at all...I am simply using it to gauge if the assignments are too easy or hard</i>)<BR><BR></li>
										<li>Your overall impression of the assignment.  Did you love it, hate it, or were you neutral?  One word answers are fine, but if you have any suggestions for the future let me know.<BR><BR></li>
										
										<li>Any other concerns that you have.  For instance, if you have a bug that you were unable to solve but you made progress, write that here.  The more you articulate the problem the more partial credit you will receive (fine to leave this blank)</li>
										</ol>
										
										If you are in a situation where you are unable to debug your code fully before the deadline, you will get more partial credit if you also submit debugging tools (HTML files, etc) with descriptions of what you tried and what the problem is.  In this case, please briefly describe all extra files in the README.<BR><BR>
										
										
										Study this code carefully and post on Microsoft Teams if you have any questions

										<h2><a name = "part1">Part 1</a> (Due Wednesday 9/4 at 11:59PM)</h2>

										<h2><a name = "example">Task 1: Vector Projection (5 Points)</a></h2>
										
										Write functions to use the dot product formulas to perform vector projection, using the <a href = "http://glmatrix.net/docs/2.2.0/symbols/vec3.html">vec3</a> class.  You will write on function for parallel projection and one function for perpendicular projection of vectors (what's left over after parallel projection)<BR><BR>

										<h2><a name = "angle">Task 2: Angle Computation (5 points)</a></h2>
										
										Given points <b>a</b>, <b>b</b> and <b>c</b>, compute the angle <b>in degrees</b> between <b>b</b> and <b>c</b> with respect to <b>a</b>, as shown in the picture below<BR><BR>

										<h2><a name = "area">Task 3: Triangle Area Computation (5 points)</a></h2>
										
										Use the fact that the magnitude of the cross product of two vectors is the area of the parallelogram spanned by those two vectors to compute the area of a triangle enclosed by three points in 3D.<BR><BR>
										Alternatively, you can use the dot product and the fact that 
										<h3>\[ \sin(\theta) = \sqrt{ 1 - \cos^2(\theta) } \]</h3>
										(this is simply the pythagorean theorem on unit triangles)
